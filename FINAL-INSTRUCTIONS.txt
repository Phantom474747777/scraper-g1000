  SCRAPER G1000 - FINAL SETUP
========================================

I completely redid everything from scratch.

Deleted:
- All 35+ diagnostic files
- All confusing instructions
- All the junk I created

Kept:
- START-GUI.bat (simple launcher)
- INSTALL-DEPENDENCIES.bat (package installer)
- scraper-g1000.py (with error logging)
- Your blue SG logo
- All app files

========================================
  WHAT TO DO NOW
========================================

Step 1: Pull Latest Code
-------------------------
In GitHub Desktop:
  - Click "Fetch origin"
  - Click "Pull origin"

Step 2: Install Packages (ONE TIME ONLY)
-----------------------------------------
In your scraper-g1000 folder:
  - Double-click: INSTALL-DEPENDENCIES.bat
  - Wait 2-3 minutes
  - It will say "Done!"

Step 3: Launch the App
-----------------------
  - Double-click: START-GUI.bat
  - App should open

Step 4: If It Crashes
----------------------
Look for a file called: startup.log

Send me the contents of that file.
It will show the EXACT error.

========================================
  HOW IT WORKS NOW
========================================

START-GUI.bat:
  1. Tries to find Python (3 different ways)
  2. Runs scraper-g1000.py
  3. Window stays open if there's an error

scraper-g1000.py:
  - Writes startup.log immediately
  - Shows which packages loaded successfully
  - Shows which packages failed
  - Waits for you to press Enter if error

========================================
  THAT'S IT
========================================

Just 2 files you care about:
  1. INSTALL-DEPENDENCIES.bat (run once)
  2. START-GUI.bat (run to open app)

If crash → check startup.log
