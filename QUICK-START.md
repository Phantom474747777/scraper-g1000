# Quick Start Guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Pull Latest Code First

```bash
git pull
```

## Then Follow These Steps:

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies (First Time Only)
Double-click: **INSTALL-DEPENDENCIES.bat**

Wait for it to finish (2-5 minutes)

### 2️⃣ Launch the App
Double-click: **START-GUI.bat**

### 3️⃣ If It Crashes
Double-click: **CREATE-CRASH-LOG.bat**

Then send me the **CRASH-LOG.txt** file it creates

---

## Files You Should See After Pulling:

✓ START-GUI.bat
✓ INSTALL-DEPENDENCIES.bat
✓ CREATE-CRASH-LOG.bat
✓ scraper-g1000.py
✓ START-HERE-INSTRUCTIONS.txt (this file)

**If you don't see these files, you need to pull the latest code from GitHub.**

## Don't Use Desktop Shortcuts Yet

Navigate to the **actual project folder** and run the .bat files from there.

Desktop shortcuts might point to old locations.
