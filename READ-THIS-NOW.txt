SCRAPER G1000 - FINAL SOLUTION
================================================================

Your batch files keep closing instantly. Here's the fix:

================================================================
OPTION 1: Create Log File (EASIEST)
================================================================

Double-click: CREATE-CRASH-LOG.bat

This will:
- Create CRASH-LOG.txt with all errors
- Auto-open the log file in Notepad
- Window can close - we don't care, the log is saved

Look for CRASH-LOG.txt in the folder and SEND IT TO ME.

================================================================
OPTION 2: Run Diagnostic Script
================================================================

Double-click: RUN-DIAGNOSTIC.bat

This creates FULL-DIAGNOSTIC.txt with complete system analysis.
SEND ME THIS FILE.

================================================================
OPTION 3: Manual Command Prompt (GUARANTEED TO WORK)
================================================================

Read: MANUAL-INSTRUCTIONS.txt

This shows you how to:
1. Open Command Prompt yourself
2. Navigate to the folder
3. Run the app manually
4. See all errors directly

This CANNOT fail because you're doing it manually.

================================================================
WHICH ONE SHOULD I USE?
================================================================

Try them in this order:

1. CREATE-CRASH-LOG.bat
2. RUN-DIAGNOSTIC.bat
3. Follow MANUAL-INSTRUCTIONS.txt

One of these WILL create a log file you can send me.

================================================================
THE FILES YOU'LL GET
================================================================

CRASH-LOG.txt        → Created by CREATE-CRASH-LOG.bat
FULL-DIAGNOSTIC.txt  → Created by RUN-DIAGNOSTIC.bat
manual-error-log.txt → Created by manual method

Send me whichever file gets created.
